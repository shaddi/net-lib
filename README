*******************************************************************************
* GETTING STARTED
*******************************************************************************

 * You will need to copy netlib/configExample.py to config.py and edit it to
   match your lab and user details.  The config file is not tracked by git
   because we do not want to accidentally over write your config, and we don't
   want to make it easier for you to send us data that you don't want to via a
   patch.

 * Prerequisites:
    - Python2.6 (Python2.7 needed to run unit tests) 
    - Paswordless SSH to end systems
    - SSH aliases for end systems (there are workarounds for this)
    - Passwordless sudo for end systems (there are workarounds for this too)

 * Binary dependencies:
    - iperf
    - tcpdump
    - Python2.6 (required on end systems for netlib.data.client)

 * Your first stop should be the wiki http://code.google.com/p/net-lib/w/list
 * THEN you can try the mailing list https://groups.google.com/group/net-lib
